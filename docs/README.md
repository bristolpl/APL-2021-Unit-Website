Advanced Topics in Programming Languages is a fourth year optional unit at the University of Bristol. We will give you a grounding in the field of Programming Languages, along with an insight into what it is like to be Programming Languages researcher.

The unit will be based on Robert Harper's book _Practical Foundations for Programming Languages]. An [electronic copy](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/958542871) may be obtained through the University of Bristol's library.
